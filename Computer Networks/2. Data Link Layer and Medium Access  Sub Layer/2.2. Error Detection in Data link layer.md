# 2.2. Error Detection and correction in Data link layer

> This section comes under the LLC Section of Data Link Layer

**Error occurs when the receiver receives the data which is not exactly what the sender sent.**

Types of Error:
- Single Bit Error: Example, sender sends 101 and receiver receives 100. Any one bit is changed.
- Burst Error: Example, sender sends 1001101 and receiver receives 1000100. More than one bit is changed.

#### Detection techniques:
- Single Parity
- 2D Parity Check
- Checksum
- CRC (Cyclic
- Redundancy Check)

#### Correction:
- Hamming Codes

### Single Parity
- Least expensive method
- Here we send one extra bit with the message. (m + 1).
- Even Parity is used. Means no of `1` should be even. If Odd Parity is used then no of `1` should be odd.
  Example, let's say we are sending the data as `1010` here `1`s are even so the extra bit will be `0`. So the message will be `10100`
- Can detect any single bit code words but cannot do corrections.
- Can detect errors if any odd number of bits are changed.

> Hamming Distance:

Take any two code words and perform XOR operation between them and count the no of `1`s, the count is the hamming distance.


### CRC: Cyclic Redundancy Check
- Can detect all odd errors, single bit, burst errors of length equals to highest polynomial degree.

`Total bits: message bits + redundant bits`

**Example**
Given dividend `10101010`
Given polynomial: `x^4 + x^3 + 1`

So the actual dividend will be `101010100000` Four 0s are added because the highest degree in the polynomial is 4.

So divisor = All the quotient of the polynomial
=>  `1.x^4 + 1.x^3 + 0.x^2 + 0.x^1 1x^0`
=> `11001`

> **Note:** If polynomial not given and directly the binary is given then the added 0s will be `divisor bits - 1`

Now we have to perform binary division using XOR:
And remainder is: `000010`

We've to append the remainder to the and remove the 4 0s we have added to the dividend. And the remainder will be added from LSB

**So the dividend will be  `101010100010`**

### Hamming Codes
- Hamming codes are used to detect and correct single bit errors.
- It is a method of error detection and correction that uses redundancy bits to ensure that the data can be recovered even if one bit is corrupted.
- Hamming codes are based on the concept of parity bits, which are additional bits added to the data to ensure that the total number of 1s in the data is even or odd.

#### Example of Hamming Code for Error Detection and Correction

Let's work through an example of using Hamming codes for a 4-bit data word (1010).

**Step 1: Determine the number of redundancy bits (r)**
- For a data word of m bits, we need to satisfy: 2^r ≥ m + r + 1
- For m = 4: 
    - r = 3 because 2^3 = 8 ≥ 4 + 3 + 1 = 8

**Step 2: Position the bits**
- Position the parity bits at positions that are powers of 2: 1, 2, 4
- Data bits go in the remaining positions: 3, 5, 6, 7
- So the code word looks like: p₁p₂d₁p₃d₂d₃d₄ (where p = parity bit, d = data bit)

**Step 3: Assign data bits**
- Place the data (1010) in positions 3, 5, 6, 7
- So our code word is now: p₁p₂1p₃010

**Step 4: Calculate parity bits**
- p₁ (position 1): checks bits 1, 3, 5, 7 (p₁, d₁, d₂, d₄) → 1+0+0 must be even → p₁ = 1
- p₂ (position 2): checks bits 2, 3, 6, 7 (p₂, d₁, d₃, d₄) → 1+1+0 must be even → p₂ = 0
- p₄ (position 4): checks bits 4, 5, 6, 7 (p₃, d₂, d₃, d₄) → 0+1+0 must be even → p₄ = 1

**Step 5: Final code word**
- The complete code word is: 1010110

**Error Detection and Correction:**
- Suppose during transmission the bit in position 6 is flipped: 1010**0**10
- At the receiver:
    - Check 1: p₁ + d₁ + d₂ + d₄ = 1+1+0+0 = 2 (even) → correct
    - Check 2: p₂ + d₁ + d₃ + d₄ = 0+1+0+0 = 1 (odd) → error
    - Check 4: p₄ + d₂ + d₃ + d₄ = 1+0+0+0 = 1 (odd) → error
- Error position = 2 + 4 = 6
- Flip bit at position 6 to correct: 1010**1**10 (corrected)

This example shows how Hamming codes can both detect and correct a single bit error by using the parity bits to identify the exact position of the error.
