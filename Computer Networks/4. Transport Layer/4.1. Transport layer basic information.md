# 4.1 Transport Layer Basic Information

The transport layer is the fourth layer in the OSI model and plays a crucial role in end-to-end communication between devices across networks. It is responsible for:

- Segmenting data from the session layer
- Establishing end-to-end connections between hosts
- Reliable data transfer
- Flow control
- Congestion control

## Key Transport Layer Protocols

### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- Connection-oriented protocol
- Provides reliable data delivery
- Implements flow control and congestion control
- Three-way handshake for connection establishment
- Guarantees ordered delivery

### UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
- Connectionless protocol
- No guarantee of delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection
- Lower overhead and latency than TCP
- Used for applications where speed is more critical than reliability

## Transport Layer Functions

- **Multiplexing/Demultiplexing**: Managing multiple connections using ports
- **Error Control**: Detecting and recovering from errors
- **Flow Control**: Preventing sender from overwhelming receiver
- **Congestion Control**: Preventing network overload

## Relationship with Network Layer

The transport layer relies on the network layer for routing and delivery. While the network layer handles:
- Address mapping (ARP, RARP, BOOTP, DHCP)
- Delivery and forwarding mechanisms
- Unicast routing protocols

The transport layer focuses on end-to-end communication services between applications.
