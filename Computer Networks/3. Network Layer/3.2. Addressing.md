# 3.2 Addressing in the Network Layer

The network layer needs a way to identify devices on a network. This is where logical addressing comes into play. Let's explore the two main addressing schemes used in the Internet today.

## IPV4 (Internet Protocol Version 4)

IPV4 is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol and has been the primary addressing system for the Internet since the early 1980s.

### Key Features:
- Uses 32-bit addresses (4 bytes)
- Written in dotted-decimal notation (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
- Can represent approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses
- Divided into network portion and host portion
- Often used with subnetting to create smaller network segments

### Address Classes:
- Class A: Large networks (First bit is 0)
- Class B: Medium-sized networks (First two bits are 10)
- Class C: Small networks (First three bits are 110)
- Class D: Multicast addresses (First four bits are 1110)
- Class E: Reserved (First four bits are 1111)

### Limitations:
- Limited address space which led to the development of techniques like NAT (Network Address Translation)
- Doesn't inherently support security features
- Requires manual configuration in many cases

## IPV6 (Internet Protocol Version 6)

IPV6 was developed to address the limitations of IPV4, particularly the exhaustion of available addresses.

### Key Features:
- Uses 128-bit addresses (16 bytes)
- Written in hexadecimal notation with colons separating groups of 4 hex digits (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334)
- Can represent an enormous number of addresses (approximately 3.4 Ã— 10^38)
- Has built-in support for security and mobility
- Supports autoconfiguration of addresses

### Advantages over IPV4:
- Vastly larger address space
- Simplified header format for more efficient routing
- Built-in support for authentication and privacy
- Better support for quality of service (QoS)
- Eliminates the need for NAT in most cases

### Types of IPV6 Addresses:
- Unicast: Identifies a single network interface
- Multicast: Identifies a group of interfaces
- Anycast: Delivered to the nearest of a group of interfaces

The transition from IPV4 to IPV6 is ongoing, with many networks running both protocols simultaneously through various transition mechanisms.
