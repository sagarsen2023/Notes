# Network Layer: Address Mapping & Routing

The network layer plays a crucial role in moving packets across networks. Let's understand some key concepts.

## Address Mapping Protocols

### ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
- **Purpose**: Maps IP addresses (logical) to MAC addresses (physical)
- **How it works**: 
    - A device needs to send data to an IP address on the same network
    - It broadcasts an ARP request: "Who has this IP address?"
    - The device with that IP responds with its MAC address
    - The sender stores this mapping in its ARP cache for future use

### RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol)
- **Purpose**: Maps MAC addresses to IP addresses
- **Use case**: Diskless workstations that know their MAC address but need an IP address
- **How it works**: Device sends its MAC address to a RARP server that responds with an IP address

### BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol)
- **Purpose**: Helps a diskless workstation discover its IP address and boot server
- **Features**: Static address assignment based on MAC address
- **Limitation**: Requires manual configuration for each client

### DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
- **Purpose**: Automatically assigns IP addresses and network configuration
- **Features**:
    - Dynamic address allocation
    - Address leasing with renewal
    - Provides additional information (default gateway, DNS servers, etc.)
    - Backward compatible with BOOTP

## Packet Delivery and Forwarding

- **Direct delivery**: Source and destination on the same network
- **Indirect delivery**: Packets travel through routers to reach different networks
- **Forwarding**: Process of moving packets from input to appropriate output port

## Unicast Routing Protocols

Routing protocols help determine the best path for packets to travel:

### Distance Vector Protocols
- Examples: RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
- Based on hop count and shared information with neighbors

### Link State Protocols
- Examples: OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
- Each router builds a complete map of the network

### Path Vector Protocols
- Examples: BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)
- Used for routing between different autonomous systems on the internet
