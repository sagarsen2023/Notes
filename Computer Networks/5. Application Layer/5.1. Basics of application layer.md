# 5.1 Basics of Application Layer

The application layer is the highest layer in the TCP/IP model, dealing directly with user applications. It provides network services to end-users.

## Domain Name System (DNS)
- Hierarchical naming system for computers and resources
- Translates domain names to IP addresses
- Uses distributed database architecture
- Key components: DNS servers, resolvers, resource records

### Dynamic DNS (DDNS)
- Allows automatic updates to DNS when IP addresses change
- Useful for devices with dynamic IP addresses
- Popular service for home servers and IoT devices

## Network Applications and Protocols

### TELNET
- Terminal emulation protocol
- Provides bidirectional text-oriented communication
- Uses TCP port 23
- Largely replaced by SSH due to security concerns

### EMAIL
- Protocols: SMTP, POP3, IMAP
- SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): For sending emails
- POP3 (Post Office Protocol): For retrieving emails
- IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol): Advanced email retrieval

### File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
- Standard for transferring files between computers
- Uses separate control and data connections
- Active vs. passive FTP modes
- Common ports: 20 (data), 21 (control)

### World Wide Web (WWW)
- Global information system accessible via the Internet
- Based on hypertext documents (HTML)
- Key components: browsers, web servers, HTML/CSS/JavaScript

### HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
- Foundation protocol for the WWW
- Request-response model
- Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
- Status codes: 2xx (success), 3xx (redirection), 4xx (client error), 5xx (server error)

### SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)
- For collecting and organizing information about managed devices
- Used for network monitoring and management
- Components: managed devices, agents, NMS (Network Management Systems)

### Bluetooth
- Wireless technology standard for data exchange
- Short-range communication protocol
- Versions and evolving capabilities
- Profiles for different applications

## Network Security

### Firewalls
- Hardware or software barriers between networks
- Types: packet filtering, stateful inspection, application layer
- Functions: access control, logging, address translation
- Deployment: network-based, host-based

### Basic Concepts of Cryptography
- Encryption and decryption
- Symmetric vs. asymmetric encryption
- Hash functions and digital signatures
- Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
- Common algorithms: AES, RSA, SHA
