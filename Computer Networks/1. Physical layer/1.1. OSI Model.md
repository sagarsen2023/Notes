The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)** Model is a set of rules that explains how different computer systems communicate over a network. OSI Model was developed by the **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)**. The OSI Model consists of 7 layers and each layer has specific functions and responsibilities. This layered approach makes it easier for different devices and technologies to work together. OSI Model provides a clear structure for data transmission and managing network issues. The OSI Model is widely used as a reference to understand how network systems function.

#### Layers of the OSI Model
There are 7 layers in the OSI Model and each layer has its specific role in handling data. All the layers are mentioned below:

1. Physical Layer
2. Data Link Layer
3. Network Layer
4. Transport Layer
5. Session Layer
6. Presentation Layer
7. Application Layer
